## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip
* git

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ToolForge.git
   cd ToolForge
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r gradio_webui/requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

4. Set up your API keys as described in SETUP_GUIDE.md

5. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Make your changes in your feature branch
2. Add or update tests as needed
3. Update documentation if you're changing functionality
4. Run tests to make sure everything works
5. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"
   ```

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits specification:

* `feat:` - A new feature
* `fix:` - A bug fix
* `docs:` - Documentation only changes
* `style:` - Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code
* `refactor:` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* `perf:` - A code change that improves performance
* `test:` - Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat: add support for Claude 3 models

- Add Claude 3 model detection
- Update API client for Claude compatibility
- Add configuration examples
```

### Submitting Your Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Open a Pull Request from your fork to the main repository

3. In your PR description:
   * Describe what changes you made and why
   * Reference any related issues
   * Include screenshots if UI changes are involved
   * List any breaking changes

4. Wait for review and address any feedback

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

* Follow PEP 8
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add docstrings to functions and classes
* Keep functions focused and concise
* Use type hints where appropriate

Example:
```python
def process_data(input_file: str, max_lines: int = 100) -> dict:
    """
    Process data from input file.
    
    Args:
        input_file: Path to the input JSONL file
        max_lines: Maximum number of lines to process
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processing results
        
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If input file doesn't exist
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use clear, concise language
* Include code examples where helpful
* Use proper markdown formatting
* Keep the tone friendly and helpful
* Update the README if you're adding a new feature

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
